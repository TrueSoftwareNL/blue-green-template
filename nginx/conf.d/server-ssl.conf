# SSL certificates — stable paths for both certbot and self-signed
# These files are placed by:
#   - scripts/generate-self-signed-ssl.sh (local development)
#   - scripts/init-letsencrypt.sh (production with Let's Encrypt)
# Both scripts output certs to nginx/ssl/ which is mounted at /etc/nginx/ssl/
