# =============================================================================
# Health Check Wait Script
# =============================================================================
# Polls Docker Compose service health until all replicas are healthy.
# Used by switch-environment.sh to verify new replicas before switching traffic.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/health-check-wait.sh <service-name> [timeout-seconds] [poll-interval]
#
# Arguments:
#   service-name    Docker Compose service name (e.g., app_blue, app_green)
#   timeout-seconds Maximum seconds to wait (default: 120)
#   poll-interval   Seconds between polls (default: 2)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = All replicas healthy
#   1 = Timeout — not all replicas became healthy
# =============================================================================
